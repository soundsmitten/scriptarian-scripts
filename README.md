# Scriptarian Scripts

[Scriptarian](https://scriptarian.com) allows you to easily automate macOS using the Swift programming language, providing a modern alternative to AppleScript. It's a little rough around the edges, but only $10, and I've found it to be easier to use than the Apple-rolled solutions.

Here are some of my scripts. I like to trigger the compiled executable in Keyboard Maestro.

1. airplay**
	- Change the AirPlay devices.
2. feedadd
	- add the frontmost Safari url to your default feed reader.
